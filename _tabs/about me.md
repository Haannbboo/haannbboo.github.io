> Squeeze the most from simple data

I am Hanbo Guo. I am a senior student at [UIUC CS](https://cs.illinois.edu/), set to graduate in May 2024. Wanting to do research recently. [[CV]](/assets/CV.Hanbo_Guo.pdf)

I am interested in building large systems with complex **data** flow. Some ideas... what about a distributed low latency data pipeline for high-frequency trading? 
Or maybe a huge sensor network that pushes inferencing in edges.

I am also investing on the side, buying myself <i class="fas fa-coffee"></i> everyday.

### Other Activities

I am a fan of <i class='fas fa-basketball-ball' style='font-size;color:brown'></i> [Denver Nuggets](https://twitter.com/nuggets?). I play and develop APIs for <i class="fas fa-dice"></i> [EVE-Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).

Btw, EVE-Online is a good place to test ideas on high-frequency trading. It has a player-driven market (around 30K players), with data access to order books and buy/sell spreads.
