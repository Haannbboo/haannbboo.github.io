### Other Activities

I am a fan of <i class='fas fa-basketball-ball' style='font-size;color:brown'></i> [Denver Nuggets](https://twitter.com/nuggets?). I play and develop APIs for <i class="fas fa-dice"></i> [EVE-Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).

Btw, EVE-Online is a good place to test ideas on high-frequency trading. It has a player-driven market (around 30K players), with API access to order books and buy/sell spreads.
